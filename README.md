This repository is the starter code for Assignment 2 - JavaScript Methods. 

## JavaScript Prototype: Method ##
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property called "prototype." 

The prototype constructor is used to add new methods (functions) and properties to a JavaScript object. 
- If a method is constructed, then it will be available for the object. 
- If a property is constructed, then the object will be given the property and its value, as default.

In this assignment, we use the prototype constructor to add new methods to the Array() object.

----------
### 1. Use the following process to ***import*** the Assignment 2 starter code  repository to your GitHub account as the starter codebase
1.	Log on to GitHub
2.	Click on the + sign in the top right corner (next to the user icon)
3.	In the dropdown menu, select "Import repository"
4.	A new page will open
5.	In "Your old repository’s clone URL" field, enter: `https://github.com/johnnylaicode/grid-maker-starter-code`
6.	In "Your new repository details" field, enter your own repository name (e.g., "assignment-2")
7.	Click on the "Begin import" button to start the process
8.	After the process completed, your new "assignment-2" repository is created – as a completely independent codebase
9.	From this point on, you can clone your new repository, make changes, create feature branches, and create/merge pull requests
